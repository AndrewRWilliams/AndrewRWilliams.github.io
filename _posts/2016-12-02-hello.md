This nothing but a simple `hello world` post.

In posts, you can use  to control what will be shown in the excerpt.

For example, this post should be shown until here ...

<script type="module"
src="https://gradio.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3.4.1/gradio.js">
</script>

<gradio-app space="abidlabs/pytorch-image-classifier"></gradio-app>


... but not any further.
