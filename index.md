## Hi, I'm Andrew.

I am a Phd student under Irina Rish at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" style="color:#7B2679;text-decoration:none">Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a> and <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/" style="color:#006BB6;text-decoration:none"><i>Université de Montréal</i></a> and Nicolas Chapados at <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/research/"> ServiceNow Research</a>, where I am currently a visiting researcher.
I am interested in the use of foundation models to support decision-making under uncertainty.

My current research interests include:
* Forecasting foundation models that leverage transfer learning and "context", i.e. additional information such as relevant documents.
* Multi-agent simulations for policy design and evaluation, e.g. agent-based models for climate-economic agreement design through negotiation protocols.
* AI to support literature exploration, review and synthesis in ambiguous settings, such as for climate-economic policy design.

Previously, I worked on multi-agent deep learning for social good as an intern in [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/)'s lab.
I also consulted on AI and Education at the
<a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/" style="color:#006BB6;text-decoration:none"><i>Université de Montréal</i></a>'s
university pedagogy center.
Before that, I completed an M.Sc. on quantum machine learning at the Université de Montréal's LITQ lab under
[Gilles Brassard](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~brassard/web/en/) and [Alain Tapp](https://sites.google.com/view/alain-tapp-mila/).
Even before that, I completed a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Economics at Concordia University.
