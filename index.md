## Hi, I'm Andrew.

I am a Phd student in the CERC-AAI lab under Irina Rish at <a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" style="color:#7B2679;text-decoration:none">Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a> and <a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/" style="color:#006BB6;text-decoration:none"><i>Université de Montréal</i></a>.
I am currently a Visting Researcher at <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/research/"> ServiceNow Research</a>, where my main focus is on time series forecasting.
Previously, I worked on multi-agent deep learning for social good as an intern in [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/)'s lab.
I also consulted on AI and Education at the
<a href="https://www.umontreal.ca/" style="color:#006BB6;text-decoration:none"><i>Université de Montréal</i></a>'s
university pedagogy center.
Before that, I completed an M.Sc. on quantum machine learning at the Université de Montréal's LITQ lab under
[Gilles Brassard](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~brassard/web/en/) and [Alain Tapp](https://sites.google.com/view/alain-tapp-mila/).

My current research interests include:
* general-purpose forecasting methods, especially the relevance of additional, non-numerical contextual information.
* the relationship between accurate forecasts, control theory and capable world models.
* Forecasting in multi-agent settings, in particular the impact of negotiation.
