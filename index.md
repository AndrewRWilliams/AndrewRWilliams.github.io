I work on AIxEducation at the <span style="color:#006BB6">Université de Montréal</span>. 
I'm also an intern in  [Yoshua Bengio](https://yoshuabengio.org/)'s lab at 
<a href="https://mila.quebec/en/" style="color:#7B2679;">Mila - Quebec AI Institute</a> in Montréal, Canada.



My work primarily focuses on AI and interaction, both in research and implementation.
<span style="color:#006BB6">I work on the intersection of AI and education, and how AI and the learning experience can improve each other.</span>
<span style="color:#7B2679">I also research how AI can be used to understand interaction and learning, and how we can use this understanding to improve AI.</span>
